## 💻 Project

This repository contains a Web API for studies with `DotNetAI` , `OpenAI` and others. 
The project's source code is based on the course: [Inteligência Artificial c .NET AI DeepSeek OpenAI e ChatGPT](https://www.udemy.com/course/net-ai-com-aspnet-openai-chatgpt-deepseek-ollama-mcp-gemini-e-grok/) 

## 🚀 Technologies and Tools

This project was developed using the following technologies:

- **Backend:**  
  - `.NET 10`
  - `ASP.NET Core WebAPI`
  - `C#`
  - `OpenAI Platform`
  - `OpenAi DotNet`
  - `Scalar`
 
## 📌 Technical Decisions

- This project was built using a standard ASP.NET Core Web API structure, kept intentionally simple to focus on the OpenAI Platform integration.
- The overall architecture was aligned with the structure presented in the reference course to maintain consistency and clarity.
- Even with a basic setup, clean code principles and good development practices were carefully applied throughout the implementation.

## 📘 Notes

To interact with the OpenAI Platform, you must generate your own API key by accessing the [OpenAI API Keys page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

Please note that usage of this API key is subject to OpenAI's pricing and usage policies. Refer to the [OpenAI Pricing](https://openai.com/pricing) page for up-to-date information.

In this project, the API key is securely configured through environment variables in the operating system. This approach keeps sensitive credentials out of source control and ensures proper separation of configuration and code.
